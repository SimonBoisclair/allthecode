## Description
I've included a main.js file and an index.html file
Do not modify them!
main.js imports two files: a.js and b.js  
It is up to you to write those two imported files

The file a.js exports one function called concatString. It has two arguments. It simply returns the sum of the two arguments.
The file b.js exports one function called capitalizeString. It has one argument. It returns a capitalized version of the argument.

Your job: 
1. Write those two files
2. Run webpack so that it can bundle your javascript file and library.js into the same file
3. Load the webpage and follow the instructions
